# Speed Reading App

## What is it?

This tool help you skim large amounts of text by focusing your eyes on one word at a time without having to move them. It provides a rhythm, which lowers the number of unnecessary jumps and makes you more focused. Current beta testers report reading twice as much in half the timeâ€”that's a 300% increase in reading speed, without any loss in comprehension!
